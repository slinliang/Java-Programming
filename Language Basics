#Variables
  Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields): unique to each instance of a class.
  Class Variables (Static Fields): exactly one copy of this variable in existence.
  Loval Variables: accessible only with a method.
  Parameters: variables in method signature.
  
 #Primitive Data Types
  byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. -128-127.
  
  short: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. -32768-32767.
  
  int: By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -2^31 and a maximum value of
    2^31-1. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer, which has a minimum value of 0 
    and a maximum value of 2^32-1.
    
  long: The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -2^63 and a maximum value of 2^63-1.
    In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the long data type to represent an unsigned 64-bit long, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum
    value of 2^64-1. 
    
  float: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
  
  double: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
  
  boolean: The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false.
  
  char: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of 
    '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).
